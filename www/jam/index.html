        <p>
          From the détournement images of the Situationist International to the plundered sampled tracks of sonic outlaws, activist media artists in the later half of the 20th century deployed a medley of piratical practices in their quest to challenge and subvert our mainstream media culture. While the institutional critiques posed by these "culture jammers" remain as salient as ever, the creative techniques themselves no longer have the same effect in the age of social media and surveillance capitalism. As new media theorist Curt Cloninger asked in 2009, "How do you hack/resist a platform that already allows (indeed, invites) you to customize it?" This is the question we will set out to answer in this course. We'll look at works and study the practices of new media artists who have adapted these culture jamming techniques for the present moment. We'll learn how glitch artists exploit bugs in software to databend and datamosh media files. We'll learn how hacktivist use information security tools for creative political ends. We'll explore radical networks that exist outside the mainstream Internet and learn to tactically misuse our apps to circumvent restrictions imposed by popular platforms. At the end of this journey we'll respond to Cloninger's challenge by reframing these techniques as new modes of culture jamming for the digital age.

        <h2>Evaluation</h2>

        <ul>

            <span>50%:</span><span>class participation</span>

        <p>
          <b>class discussions</b>: So much of what we’re going to cover in class, both in terms of the theory and practice, can be gleaned through your own online research. The most valuable aspect of learning this material in the classroom (albeit virtually this quarter), rather than on your own, is the chance for realtime interactivity with your professor and peers. I can not stress enough how important it is to take advantage of class discussions. The first half of the quarter will be focused on researching different themes and artists, you will need to complete viewings and readings each week of the first half quarter in order to fully participate in our class discussions. The second half of the quarter will be devoted to the development of the final project (see below), participation in class discussions will mean both sharing your ideas and work in progress as well as providing feedback to your peers.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>final project</b>: Throughout the quarter we'll be looking at examples of "culture jamming" artists working in different mediums from the latter half of the 20th century to today. By the end of the quarter you will be expected to have produced a culture jamming work in response to mainstream digital culture. The work itself can be produced in any medium, so long as it aims to subvert and or criticize some aspect of contemporary culture you take issue with. The final presentation itself will not be a presentation of the work (which may or may not be complete or fully realized) and will instead be documentation of the process (instructions, tutorial, etc) others can follow in order to execute, participate in and/or realize the work.
