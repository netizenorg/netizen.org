      <p>The event is an opportunity to engage with the urgent themes covered in the award winning documentary <em>Coded Bias</em>. 
        <blockquote cite="http://codedbias.com/about">
        <p>“When MIT Media Lab researcher Joy Buolamwini discovers that most facial-recognition software does not accurately identify darker-skinned faces and the faces of women, she delves into an investigation of widespread bias in algorithms. As it turns out, artificial intelligence is not neutral, and women are leading the charge to ensure our civil rights are protected.”</p>
