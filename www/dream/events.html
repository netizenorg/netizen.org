No one actually “Agrees” to these “Conditions”, yet short of abandoning all modern conveniences, resistance seems futile. But fear not!

Data Rules Everything Around Me (D.R.E.A.M.) is a roughly-monthly series devoted to openly discussing these topics. Featured writers, artists, developers and other cultural producers are invited to share their research and perspectives on the data that fuels the systems that run our world.">

The parts of the Internet people experience daily via phones and laptops are merely the peripheral edge of a powerful and complex global network, one which tends to be simplified into metaphors like "the cloud." This abstraction makes it easier to retain particular narratives of power.</p>
