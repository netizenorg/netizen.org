        The playlist bellow is from an older video series i made (2016), but it covers many of the core perspectives/concepts/background covered in the Internet Art I course. If you did not take the intro course you should start by watching the 4 videos in this playlist.

      <p>
        The playlist bellow is a crash course on HTML + CSS from the perspective covered in the intro course. If you open the videos up on YouTube you can access a "table of contents" (shortcut links to specific topics covered in the videos) as well as links to any references mentioned in the video description. Most of the assignments this quarter will assume you understand everything covered in the playlist of videos bellow (this includes how to setup a web project, how to avoid some common mistakes, how to write basic HTML + CSS and how to host a web project on GitHub).

      <p>
        In the first video I make reference to the class notes on <a href="../hypermedia/index.html">hypermedia</a> and <a href="../net-art/index.html">net.art</a> (you should review these as well). If you'd like a deeper dive into the material covered in the intro course feel free to poke around and explore as much of the material on the <a href="../netart1" target="_blank">Internet Art I</a> website as you'd like.
