        <h3>THE IMPERATIVE TO BREAK THE LAW</h3>
        <p>"All popular music (and all folk music, by definition), essentially, if not legally, exists in a public domain. Listening to pop music isn't a matter of choice. Asked for or not, we're bombarded by it. In its most insidious state, filtered to an incessant bass-line, it seeps through apartment walls and out of the heads of walk people. Although people in general are making more noise than ever before, fewer people are making more of the total noise; specifically, in music, those with megawatt PA's, triple platinum sales, and heavy rotation. Difficult to ignore, pointlessly redundant to imitate, how does one not become a passive recipient?"</p>

          (from Curt Cloninger's essay "<a href="http://lab404.com/articles/commodify_your_consumption.pdf" target="_blank">Commodify Your Consumption: Tactical Surfing / Wakes of Resistance</a>")
        </p>
        <p>The problem is, not all forms of web 2.0 "interactivity" are inherently "tactical." Put another way, mere "use" does not automatically constitute "resistance." </p>
        <p>Is using off-the-shelf corporate software to create a "unique/personal" MySpace page a way of subverting the institutions of mass media production, or is it simply one more example of these institutions using the myth of "originality" to assimilate and amass a demographic market of "unique" individuals? Artists who use these templates have to be particularly wily if they hope to keep from being assimilated and rendered "tactically" impotent. </p>
        <p>How do you hack/resist a platform that already allows (indeed, invites) you to customize it? Either we have arrived at an open source utopia and we simply need to keep using these social networking tools appreciatively in the ways that they afford; or the agency of our radical "resistance" has been rendered irrelevant because the corporations have decided to let the people eat cake (provided we eat their particular brand of interactive cake).</p>
        <p>The agency that de Certeau's consumer enacted to tactically reassemble the one- to-many media broadcasted to her in 1980 is being increasingly usurped by institutionally recommended (and protocologically enforced) modes of interactive behavior. Once the consumer mistakes these institutional "suggestions" for the exercises of her own tactical agency, she fails to exercise that actual agency. With so many "customizable options" available, how can she "resist?"</p>
        <p>In a fleeting moment of insight, Billy Joel sings, "I got remote control and a color TV / I don't change channels so they must change me." The corollary may actually be more accurate. The more I change channels, the more they change me. I sacrifice my "resistant" agency at the altar of trivial difference. The danger of MySpace and YouTube is not the threat that they may wind up archiving and owning all the "content" I produce, or that they are currently getting rich off the content I produce, but that they control the parameters within which I produce "my original" content.</p>

          From the détournement images of the Situationist International to the plundered sampled tracks of sonic outlaws, activist media artists in the later half of the 20th century deployed a medley of piratical practices in their quest to challenge and subvert our mainstream media culture. While the institutional critiques posed by these "culture jammers" remain as salient as ever, the creative techniques themselves no longer have the same effect in the age of social media and surveillance capitalism. As new media theorist Curt Cloninger asked in 2009, "How do you hack/resist a platform that already allows (indeed, invites) you to customize it?" This is the question we will set out to answer in this course. We'll look at works and study the practices of new media artists who have adapted these culture jamming techniques for the present moment. We'll learn how glitch artists exploit bugs in software to databend and datamosh media files. We'll learn how hacktivist use information security tools for creative political ends. We'll explore radical networks that exist outside the mainstream Internet and learn to tactically misuse our apps to circumvent restrictions imposed by popular platforms. At the end of this journey we'll respond to Cloninger's challenge by reframing these techniques as new modes of culture jamming for the digital age.

        <h2>Evaluation</h2>

        <ul class="box">
          <li>
            <span>50%:</span><span>class participation</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>50%:</span><span>final project</span>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <b>class discussions</b>: So much of what we’re going to cover in class, both in terms of the theory and practice, can be gleaned through your own online research. The most valuable aspect of learning this material in the classroom (albeit virtually this quarter), rather than on your own, is the chance for realtime interactivity with your professor and peers. I can not stress enough how important it is to take advantage of class discussions. The first half of the quarter will be focused on researching different themes and artists, you will need to complete viewings and readings each week of the first half quarter in order to fully participate in our class discussions. The second half of the quarter will be devoted to the development of the final project (see below), participation in class discussions will mean both sharing your ideas and work in progress as well as providing feedback to your peers.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>final project</b>: Throughout the quarter we'll be looking at examples of "culture jamming" artists working in different mediums from the latter half of the 20th century to today. By the end of the quarter you will be expected to have produced a culture jamming work in response to mainstream digital culture. The work itself can be produced in any medium, so long as it aims to subvert and or criticize some aspect of contemporary culture you take issue with. The final presentation itself will not be a presentation of the work (which may or may not be complete or fully realized) and will instead be documentation of the process (instructions, tutorial, etc) others can follow in order to execute, participate in and/or realize the work.
        </p>
