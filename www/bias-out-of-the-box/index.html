      <p>The event is an opportunity to engage with the urgent themes covered in the award winning documentary <em>Coded Bias</em>.

        <p>“When MIT Media Lab researcher Joy Buolamwini discovers that most facial-recognition software does not accurately identify darker-skinned faces and the faces of women, she delves into an investigation of widespread bias in algorithms. As it turns out, AI is not neutral, and women are leading the charge to ensure our civil rights are protected.”</p>

      <p><em>Coded Bias</em>, directed and produced by <strong class="yeltxt">Shalini Kantayya</strong>, premiered at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival and explores the fallout of MIT Media Lab researcher Joy Buolamwini´s startling discovery that facial recognition does not see dark-skinned faces and women accurately, and her journey to push for the first-ever legislation in the U.S. to govern against bias in the algorithms that impact us all. Along with <em>Coded Bias</em>, Kantayya’s debut film, <em>Catching the Sun</em>, premiered at the LA Film Festival and was named a NY Times Critics’ Pick. It was released globally on Netflix on Earth Day 2016, and was nominated for the Environmental Media Association Award for Best Documentary.
